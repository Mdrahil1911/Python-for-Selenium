#Looping statements: While, for

#Structure of looping statemnets
# Initialization
# Condition
# Incrementation/Decrementation

#EX1: while loop
i=1   #initialization
while i<=10:  #condition
    print(i)
    i=i+1     #incrementation
#this while loops continues to reapeat again and again untill the stement gets false
#if you want to print in straight line use print(i, end=" ")

#EX2: for loop
#print 1 to 10 numbers using for loop and range function

for i in range(1,11):
    print (i, end=" ")
